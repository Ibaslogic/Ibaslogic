In the previous lesson, we learned what React is, the virtual DOM, and then set up a development environment. 

Here, we’ll discuss other React fundamentals, including React components, states, and props that'll prepare us for React projects.

## React Components

Recall, in the last lesson, we rendered JSX elements directly in the root like so:

```jsx showLineNumbers
root.render(
  <div>
    <h1>Hello from React application</h1>
    <img src={reactLogo} className="logo react" alt="React logo" />
  </div>
);
```
That practice is not sustainable. 

Maintaining an application with hundreds of elements in that way would be a challenge. Instead, we will render a React component. 

React applications, as we briefly mentioned in the last lesson, are built by combining pieces of encapsulated components. These components are reusable bits of code and can be function or class-based.

### React Function and Class Components

A React class component is a component we create using [the ES6 class syntax](https://ibaslogic.com/object-oriented-programming-javascript/), while we make a function component by writing a function. This component describes the app’s behavior, including rendering the JSX element.

Like every element, the state of the JSX elements inside a component can also change. React can efficiently “react” to state changes whenever that happens to keep the DOM updated. This makes React a reactive library. 

In the earlier version of React, the class component was the de facto component required to manage component state and logic. During that time, we used the function component primarily for presentation.

However, with the [introduction of React Hooks](https://ibaslogic.com/react-hooks-tutorial/) in the React 16.8 version, the function component has become the default way of writing React components because it now manages state and component logic.

The React Hooks implementation in function components provides better code readability and presents a better way to reuse stateful logic between components. More on that in the React Hooks tutorial. 


> This React js tutorial series focuses on modern React by embracing React Hooks with function components. 
### Creating the Project Component’s Files

In the first lesson, we decomposed the UI of our todos application into multiple components: `TodoApp`, `Header`, `TodosLogic`, `InputTodo`, `TodosList`, and `TodoItem`. 

We will arrange these components to match the structure in the UI. For instance, components that appear within another component in the UI become the child of that component. That means the `Header` and `TodosLogic` components become a direct child of the `TodoApp` component. The `TodosLogic` becomes a direct parent to `InputTodo` and `TodosList` components. Finally, the `TodoItem` becomes a child of `TodosList`.

See the structure again for reference:

![react-components-structure](/static/images/react-components-data-model/react-components-structure.png)

1. **TodoApp**: the parent or root component. It holds two direct child components. 
2. **Header**: display the todos heading text.
3. **TodosLogic**: holds the application logic. It includes two direct child components. 
4. **InputTodo**: will take the user’s input.
5. **TodosList**: serves as a container for the todos items. 
6. **TodoItem**: renders the individual todos item. 

**Starting the Development Environment**
Recall from the previous lesson; we mentioned that we would use Vite for our project. So let’s start the development server using `npm run dev`. 

The files that describe what we see in the frontend live in the `src` folder. We will write the `src` files from scratch, so let’s delete all the files in the `src` folder. Doing that will instantly break the frontend UI. This is because the Vite setup needs an `src/main.jsx` entry file. 


>  For the `create-react-app` setup, the entry file is `src/index.js`. 

Let’s create a `main.jsx` file in the `src` folder and add the following code:

```jsx showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

import TodoApp from "./components/TodoApp";

const domContainer = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(domContainer);
root.render(<TodoApp />);
```

This code is similar to what we have rendered before, except that we are now **rendering our project's root component** element, `<TodoApp />`, instead of JSX. 

Notice how we imported the component using the following:

```jsx 
import TodoApp from "./components/TodoApp";
```
**We don’t have the component in a file yet; we will create it in a moment**. When importing components, we must specify the relative path from the current directory. The `import` line above implies that the `TodoApp` component will live in a `components/TodoApp.jsx` file inside the current directory, `src`. 

See the tree representation below:

```
react-todo-app
    ...
    ├── src
    │    ├── components
    │    │      └── TodoApp.jsx
    │    ├── main.jsx
    ...
```
Let’s create a `components` folder in the `src` and add the `TodoApp.jsx` file. In this file, add the following component code:

```jsx showLineNumbers
const TodoApp = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
      <p>I am in a React Component!</p>
    </div>
  );
};
export default TodoApp;
```
If we save all files and see the frontend, we will see the content of the `TodoApp` component displayed on the screen.

**Code explanation:**

We started by creating the top-level component of our project, `TodoApp`, and rendering it to the DOM. This component is a React function component created using the ES6 arrow function. It returns the JSX or React elements that describe the UI. 

Like the arrow function, we can also use a regular function to create the component. For instance, a function declaration will look like so:

```jsx showLineNumbers
function TodoApp() {
  // fn declaration
  return (
    // ...
  );
}
export default TodoApp;
```
And a function expression looks like so:

```jsx showLineNumbers
const TodoApp = function () {
  // fn expression
  return (
    // ...
  );
};
export default TodoApp;
```
Throughout the React js tutorial course, we will use the arrow function. However, we can accomplish the same result using regular functions.

<Note content="
<ul>
  <li>We must always capitalize component names.</li>  
  <li>Using a PascalCase for component file names is a good convention. For instance, <code>TodoApp.jsx</code>.</li>  
</ul> "
/>

## Support for Absolute Imports

Specifying a relative path for every imported module can result in a poor developer experience. If our application grows, we may end up with something like this: `"../../components/TodoApp"`. The problem may worsen if we change the file location, as this may warrant us updating the file paths. 

To improve the developer experience, we will configure our project to support absolute paths for imported modules. Let’s open the `vite.config.js` in the project root and add an alias for the `src` directory, so we have:

```js {2,4-8} showLineNumbers
// ...
import path from 'path';
export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
  plugins: [react()],
});
```
For the code editor to know how to resolve the alias and add intellisense, we’ll create a `jsconfig.json` in the project root and add the following:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  },
}
```
Save all files and update the `TodoApp` import in the `src/main.jsx` file to use absolute import like so:

```jsx 
import TodoApp from '@/components/TodoApp';
```
Now, we can reference any module, no matter how deeply nested inside the `src`, using `@` as the base directory. If it doesn’t work, you can restart your project. 

### Support for Absolute Imports in a create-react-app Project

For projects setup using the CRA toolchain, we can create a `jsconfig.json` in the project root and add the following code:

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```
With this configuration in a `create-react-app` project, we can import any module located at `src/components/**` like so:

```jsx
import TodoApp from "components/TodoApp";
```

## React Fragments and Multiple JSX

In the `TodoApp` component, we currently render two JSX elements, `h1`, and `p`, next to each other. In React, when we return more than one JSX element in a component, we must wrap them in an enclosing tag. In our case, we wrapped the elements inside a `div`.

However, there are times when we don’t want an extra node added to the DOM. Then, we can wrap the elements with a Fragment, `<React.Fragment>`, or use its shortcut, `<></>`:

```jsx {1,5,8} showLineNumbers
    import React from 'react';
    
    const TodoApp = () => {
      return (
        <React.Fragment>
          <h1>Hello world!</h1>
          <p>I am in a React Component!</p>
        </React.Fragment>
      );
    };
    export default TodoApp;
```
Because React is present in the scope, we imported it from the `react` module. If we don’t want to import `React`, we can use the shortcut syntax `<></>`:

```jsx {3,6} showLineNumbers
const TodoApp = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
      <p>I am in a React Component!</p>
    </>
  );
};
export default TodoApp;
```

> There are scenarios where we cannot use the shortcut `<></>` over `<React.Fragment>`. We'll discuss that later in the series.
## Creating Other Component Files

In the `src/components` folder, let’s add the following component files: `Header.jsx`, `TodosLogic.jsx`, `InputTodo.jsx`, `TodosList.jsx`, and `TodoItem.jsx`.


### Rendering the `Header` and `TodosLogic` Components

These two components are direct children of the `TodoApp` component, so let’s render them. In the `components/Header.jsx` file, create a functional component called `Header`, and render JSX like so:

```jsx showLineNumbers
const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <h1>todos</h1>
      <p>Items will persist in the browser local storage</p>
    </header>
  );
};
export default Header;
```
Next, we will render the component in the `TodoApp` parent component. Let’s open the `components/TodoApp.jsx` file, import the `Header` and render it inside the `return` statement:

```jsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import Header from '@/components/Header';

const TodoApp = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
    </>
  );
};
export default TodoApp;
```
If we save our files and look at the frontend, we should see the content of the `Header` component. 

Similarly, let’s open the `components/TodosLogic.jsx` file and create a component called `TodosLogic` with the following content:

```jsx showLineNumbers
const TodosLogic = () => {
  return (
    <div>TodosLogic content</div>
  )
}
export default TodosLogic;
```
In the meantime, we only render a simple text; we will update the component later. Now, let’s go back to the `components/TodoApp.jsx` file and render the `TodosLogic` below the `<Header />`:

```jsx {2,8} showLineNumbers
// other imports here
import TodosLogic from '@/components/TodosLogic';

const TodoApp = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <TodosLogic />
    </>
  );
};
export default TodoApp;
```
Let’s save our files and ensure the content is displayed in the frontend. 

## React Strict Mode 

The React library provides a “Strict Mode” to ensure that developers follow the React best practices while building a React application. The Strict Mode can help identify potential problems in our application during development and may log a warning message at runtime.

For now, we will enable it and move on. Occasionally, as we develop our application, we will revisit the tool. We can activate check for any part or all of our application by wrapping with the `<React.StrictMode>`. We will enable strict mode for the whole application by wrapping the root component. So, let’s open the `src/main.jsx` and update the root, so we have:

```jsx {3,5} showLineNumbers
// ...
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <TodoApp />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
Let’s save the file and ensure the application still works.

## The React Data Model

Understanding how data flows is crucial to building React applications. In React, every component tends to receive and pass pieces of information to other components in the tree. 

For instance, a component can receive data from its parent or, in some cases, from the users. To understand the data model, we will discuss the concepts of props and states in React. 

### The React Props

The props in React, also called properties, can be considered attributes in an HTML element. For instance, `type` and `value` attributes in the input element below are props:

```html 
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
```
We can use these props to pass information that changes the behavior of the input element. For example, changing the `type` attribute to `type="text"` changes the appearance of the input.

In React, **data flows from the parent down the component tree**. And the primary way to pass data down is via the props. React props, like HTML attributes, can be used to change the output of a component. When a child component receives a prop from the parent, that prop value becomes immutable that cannot be modified by the receiving component.

For that reason, we will always get the same output when we supply the same prop value to a component, thus making the component reusable in the UI without fear of uncertainty. 

### The React State

A state in React can be thought-off as the engine that moves a React application. In React, we declare a state in a component if data changes over time, usually by user interaction. For example, if the component needs to perform user interactions like updating an input field or remembering preceding events like toggling a button.

Unlike the prop, a React state in a component is local and specific to that component. It is not accessible to other components in the tree unless the holder decides to pass it down to the child component. When state data is passed down to a child component, it is passed as a prop and automatically treated as a prop in the receiving component.

## Rendering State Data

In our todos application, everything in the UI is a bunch of information. This information will also change over time and thus will be stored in a state. If we interact [with the todos application](https://react-todos-ibas.vercel.app/) and enter a task via the input field, it displays in the UI. The task can, however, be edited, deleted, or completed. We can represent the individual entry using an object that looks like so:

```js showLineNumbers
{
  id: 1,
  title: "first todos item",
  completed: false
},
// ...
```

The `title` represents the todos task; the `completed`, whose value is either `true` or `false`, will tell if a task is completed or not. The `id` will help React uniquely identify each of the tasks. 

### Identifying the Component to Place the State Data

When different components need to know about a piece of state data, we can place the state in the closest common parent. 

In the todos application, for instance, the `InputTodo` component will receive the todos from users; `TodosList` will hold the list of the task; `TodoItem` renders the individual task and displays the checkbox, edit, and delete button that modifies the state data.

Since these components all need access to the state, we will place the state in the `TodosLogic` component, which is their parent. This way, the parent can pass the data down the tree to the children that need it using the props. This process is called “**prop drilling**.”

An alternative to using prop drilling is to use the context API or state management library. For now, we will use the prop drilling approach. Later in the series, we will cover these alternatives. 

### Rendering Todos Data in the UI

In the meantime, we will initialize a `todos` variable to hold static todos data so we can render it to the UI. When we get to the React Hooks lesson, we will use a state instead.

In the `components/TodosLogic.jsx` file, let’s initialize a `todos` variable with an array of todos objects:

```jsx {2-18} showLineNumbers
const TodosLogic = () => {
  const todos = [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Setup development environment',
      completed: true,
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: 'Develop website and add content',
      completed: false,
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      title: 'Deploy to live server',
      completed: false,
    },
  ];
  return (
    // ...
  );
};
export default TodosLogic;
```
To display this data, we will loop through the `todos` array using the JavaScript `map()` function and return the title of the individual todo. The returned JSX now looks like so:

```jsx {6-10} showLineNumbers
const TodosLogic = () => {
  const todos = [
    // ...
  ];
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <li>{todo.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
export default TodosLogic;
```
Notice how we used the curly braces, `{}` to write a valid JavaScript inside the JSX. If we save the file and look at the frontend, we should see a list like so:

![rendering-state](/static/images/react-components-data-model/rendering-state.png)

Let’s ignore the warning in the browser console; we will fix it in a moment.

### Rendering the `InputTodo` and `TodosList` Components

Remember how we structured our project, the `TodosLogic` component will hold the `InputTodo` and `TodosList` components. Let’s open the `components/InputTodo.jsx` file and create a component called `InputTodo` with the following content:

```jsx showLineNumbers
const InputTodo = () => {
  return <div>input field here...</div>;
};
export default InputTodo;
```
In the meantime, we are rendering a simple text; we will update the component later. Next, let’s render the `InputTodo` above the `ul` in the `TodosLogic` component:

```jsx {1,5-6,10} showLineNumbers
import InputTodo from '@/components/InputTodo';
const TodosLogic = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <div>
      <InputTodo />
      <ul>
        {/* ... */}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
export default TodosLogic;
```

> **Note:** We wrapped the JSX with an enclosing `div` tag.

Next, instead of rendering the `ul` list in the `TodosLogic` component, we will render the `TodosList` because it is responsible for rendering the list. 

So let’s render the `<TodosList />` component below the `<InputTodo />` and pass the `todos` data down via props. The `TodosLogic` component now looks like this:

```jsx {2,10} showLineNumbers
import InputTodo from '@/components/InputTodo';
import TodosList from '@/components/TodosList';
const TodosLogic = () => {
  const todos = [
    // ...
  ];
  return (
    <div>
      <InputTodo />
      <TodosList todosProps={todos} />
    </div>
  );
};
export default TodosLogic;
```
In the code, we imported `TodosList`, **which we will create in a moment**, and rendered it below the `<InputTodo />` while passing the `todos` data via a `todosProps`. 

Once we pass down the data, we can access it in the `TodosList` child component. So let’s head over to `components/TodosList.jsx` file and create a component called `TodosList` with the following content:

```jsx showLineNumbers
const TodosList = (props) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {props.todosProps.map((todo) => (
        <li>{todo.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
export default TodosList;
```
As expected, we received a props object as an argument containing the `todosProps`. The `todosProps` contain the `todos` array data from the parent component. So we looped through it as before and rendered individual titles. If we save all files and check the frontend, we should see the items like before. 

Again, this is “prop drilling” in practice! We manually get data from the parent component down to the child component via the `todosProps` prop. 

### Destructuring the Props Object

Whenever we pass a prop to a child component, it is available in the `props` object as key-value pair. We can use object destructuring to get the actual props like so explicitly:

```jsx 
const { todosProps } = props;
```
So the `TodosList` now looks like this:

```jsx {2,5} showLineNumbers
const TodosList = (props) => {
  const { todosProps } = props;
  return (
    <ul>
      {todosProps.map((todo) => (
        <li>{todo.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
export default TodosList;
```
We are now looping through the `todosProps` and not `props.todosProps`. We can also use object destructuring directly inside the function parameter like so:

```jsx {1} showLineNumbers
const TodosList = ({ todosProps }) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todosProps.map((todo) => (
        <li>{todo.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
export default TodosList;
```
Let’s save and ensure our code still works!

### Rendering the `TodoItem` Component

Back to our project structure, a `TodoItem` component will render the actual `li` item. This component will be rendered in the `TodosList` and expected the individual todos entry to be passed down. The `TodosList` component should now look like this: 

```jsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import TodoItem from '@/components/TodoItem';
const TodosList = ({ todosProps }) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todosProps.map((todo) => (
        <TodoItem itemProp={todo} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
export default TodosList;
```
In the code, we imported `TodoItem`, **which we will create in a moment**, and rendered it in place of the `li`. After that, we passed the individual `todo` down via an `itemProp` prop. 

Let’s open the `components/TodoItem.jsx` file and create a component called `TodoItem` with the following content:

```jsx showLineNumbers
const TodoItem = ({ itemProp }) => {
  return <li>{itemProp.title}</li>;
};
export default TodoItem;
```
We received the `itemProp` prop containing the individual todo entry and then rendered the title as `li`. Let’s save and ensure our project still works!

## The `key` Prop for List Items

Whenever we render a list of items in React, we must ensure each child has a unique `key` prop. React uses the key to identify the items and know how to update them in the DOM. Not specifying a key will prompt a console warning like what we currently experience. 

To fix it, let’s open the `TodosList` component and add a `key` prop to the JSX inside the `map`:

```jsx {2} showLineNumbers
{todosProps.map((todo) => (
  <TodoItem key={todo.id} itemProp={todo} />
))}
```
Here, we are using the `id` we provided in the `todos` data. We should not see the console warning again if we save the file. 

See the current status of our project:
